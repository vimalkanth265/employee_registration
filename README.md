# employee_registration
Hi all, I have developed a simple CRUD operation with django as a server side and postgresql as the database by using pgadmin4.


Here I have developed a employee registration to save there details.

For front-end I have used HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP.
For back-end I have used django and tool crispy forms for better interface.
Data-base, I have used postgresql, if you want to use sqlite3 live the installation as it is.
